Jel
===

Jel is Jelle's editor. It's a VI-like editor, borrowing some features from Vim,
and removing stuff that the author doesn't need.

Requirements
------------
Right now, this project builds on Linux. Most of the BSDs should probably work
too. You will need to dev package of ncursesw5. You can install this on
Debian-like systems with:

sudo apt install libncursesw5-dev
